Due to covid, we have shifted most of our works to online platform. These includes classes, meetings and other stuff as well. Book My Calendar is an application which helps in booking the calendar of the owner of the event so that you can schedule meetings with the event organizer. The event organizer sets certain condition that needs to be met for the meeting to take place. If the meeting scheduler meets all the requirements of the meetings then the meeting scheduler can schedule a meeting with the event organizer. This helps in booking the calendar in advance.
